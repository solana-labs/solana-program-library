# SPL Noop Rust SDK

This create provides a wrapper for invoking `spl-noop`, which does nothing. 
It's primary use is circumventing log truncation when emitting application data by `invoke`-ing `spl-noop` with event data.

`spl-noop` and this crate's implementation are targeted towards supporting [account-compression](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/account-compression) and may be subject to change.
