## Reporting security problems in the Solana Program Library

**DO NOT CREATE A GITHUB ISSUE** to report a security problem.

Instead please use this [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/security/advisories/new) link.
Provide a helpful title and detailed description of the problem.

If you haven't done so already, please **enable two-factor auth** in your GitHub account.

Expect a response as fast as possible in the advisory, typically within 72 hours.

--

If you do not receive a response in the advisory, send an email to
security@solana.com with the full URL of the advisory you have created.  DO NOT
include attachments or provide detail sufficient for exploitation regarding the
security issue in this email. **Only provide such details in the advisory**.

If you do not receive a response from security@solana.com please followup with
the team directly. You can do this in the `#core-technology` channel of the
[Solana Tech discord server](https://solana.com/discord), by pinging the admins
in the channel and referencing the fact that you submitted a security problem.

## Security Bug Bounties
The Solana Foundation offer bounties for critical Solana security issues. Please
see the [Solana Security Bug
Bounties](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/security/policy#security-bug-bounties)
for details on classes of bugs and payment amounts.

<a name="scope"></a>
## Scope

Only a subset of programs within the Solana Program Library repo are deployed to
the Solana Mainnet Beta. Currently, this includes:

* [associated-token-account](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/associated-token-account/program)
* [feature-proposal](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/feature-proposal/program)
* [governance](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/governance/program)
* [memo](https://github.com/solana-program/memo)
* [name-service](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/name-service/program)
* [stake-pool](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/stake-pool/program)
* [token](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token/program)
* [token-2022](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token/program-2022)

If you discover a critical security issue in an out-of-scope program, your finding
may still be valuable.

Many programs, including
[token-swap](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token-swap/program)
and [token-lending](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token-lending/program),
have been forked and deployed by prominent ecosystem projects, many of which
have their own bug bounty programs.

While we cannot guarantee a bounty from another entity, we can help determine who
may be affected and put you in touch with the corresponding teams.

## Incident Response Process

In case an incident is discovered or reported, the
[Solana Security Incident Response Process](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/security/policy#incident-response-process)
will be followed to contain, respond and remediate.
